"Hello,"
can you publish a new release to the App Store for Nextcloud 17?
That's a good idea
Looking forward to that
Is someone working on this issue or is it in any release pipeline?
Iâ€™ll do it this week
Ran into some issues.
 Will update again once it's up
Any forecats on this?
Don't want to make pressure just need to know for our planning of using it soon.
Any chance we get a release within few days ?
Thanks in advance.
What's the status here?
"What's taking months, can we be of any assistance?"
I'm also eager to use it with Nextcloud 17.
And still dreaming of having an Upload Functionality within the Forms App (see #42).
Please let me know if I can support in any way.
Any chance to release it before end of January?
the version was bumped on ee65a88#diff-224bb875c5d3cfcd7621135069013242R35
Thereâ€™s releases out on the app store for Nextcloud 17 as well as for upcoming 18.
