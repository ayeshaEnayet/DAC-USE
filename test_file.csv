 Okay. I'm just clearing the path through the rubble right now. So we have access everywhere.

 Not sure. I think it's the focus should be on rescuing the green and yellow right now.
 Where you guys at right now?
MX a whole bunch of trouble
" Yeah, I'm not sure where that is. I'm going to head back and get the medic cuz I think I've cleared most of the Rebel."
We have access to believe all the victims.
 So if you're able and a stretcher roll.
" Yeah, I can just leave them here and I'll save them okay, and I could you get some other."
 Just leave him here. Thank you.
 If you could go to the back of the map.
" Yeah, that's a good idea. If you can go to the back and grab some alone some of the ones that are further away."
" Bring them closer, that would help."
 I did not. I got a credit card back down here one of the yellow victims.
" Yep, show me what you're talking about."
" Do I need to pick up is he's already safe? Yeah, he's good already. Why don't you come with me? Actually, there's a critical victim right inside this building the orange building."

"yeah, I'm going to"
 If you can see the orange.
" Yeah, come to the orange building."

" Right now follow me into this Orange Building, okay."
" perfect, and then wait Delta staying here to"
 both of you
 You should be able to.
 Are you sure?
" No, no. No. How about we rescue this critical victim first. Just take a step inside."
" There you go. Okay now just wait here one second. Okay. Just wait here to be second, son."
" Wait, just hang on one second. Okay, stay in The Orange Room."
 All right. Now we can spread out and see if there are any more victims left.
Oh.
" Oh, alright."
 Thank you.
" All right, so we still have some victims left. We do need to get you that Rubble that was in that room. I was just in so"
 I don't think that's going to happen.
" All right, brother. I'll get another critical victim in that room that I was just frozen. And so could you guys return there, please?"
 Are any of you guys?
" Are either of the emetic now? Okay, so come to this room or the safe bucket."
 Go ahead and go inside there.
 through the door
 just keep going into that room and I will be right back with a medic kit.
" Yeah, I'll be right there."
 Just stay there for a moment.
 Okay Ru it's just out there brother.
" Okay, go ahead and follow me delta."
" All right, go ahead and go to the store telephone, please and then take a right and then just hang out in there for just a second."
" Brother, can you pick up this safe lock and move it out of the way so that you can follow me."
 Right. Okay. Can you drop that one that you have out of the way not in the way?
" Yeah, that's fine. Now pick up this lock right in front of you."
 All right now follow me if you can really need to move this back to you.
I'm stuck in here.
" Yes, one of you please move that book. There you go. Now it's all go in this room place and through the rubble."
" Okay. Okay, please pick it up again."
 I know if you could pick up the safe lock with a stretcher. Is that Delta?
" Yes, and pick it up."
 But looks like you're in the same room. So guys just stay right there for a second. Okay. I'm going to say this critical victim.
 Exchange
 I'll try just a little bit longer.
 There you go. Now if you want to be a medic you can actually I'm going to need one of you to move the safe lock please.
 Wait guys. Can you come back to the room near Justin?
Guys the room you were just in.
" No, not the Archer the one to the west of The Orange Room."
 They are okay.
" No, please cancel. Yeah, can you drop that block and then move the safe lock out-of-the-way Place? Perfect. Thank you."
 There we go.
 I have you guys located any new victims that we need to save.

" Yeah, go ahead. Let me know if you find any victims along the way."
" It says say, okay, so you were already safe that back in there."
