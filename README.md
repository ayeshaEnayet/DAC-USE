# Dialogue-Act-Classification-for-Dialogue-Analysis
This repository contains a trained model for the dialogue act classification of utterances of the dialogues, based on our work available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04867.pdf. 
# Requirements:
  tensorflow: 1.15.0,
  tensorflow-hub: 0.5.0,
  keras: 2.3.1
# How it works:
Execute the file DAtagger.py, it will read the dialogue from test_file.csv and write the results to reults.File.
